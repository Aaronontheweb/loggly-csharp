This is a .NET driver for "loggly.com":http://loggly.com. It is in early development and can currently only be used to log messages (meaning the search/management stuff isn't available).

Create a new @Logger@ with your input key:
<pre>var logger = new Logger("47beab4d-74de-435f-9979-f5f318a4009f");</pre>
